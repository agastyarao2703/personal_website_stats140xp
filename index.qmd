## Projects 

#### Analyzing Airfares 

Link to [PDF Document](Final-Project-R-Markdown.pdf)

This project analyzes factors influencing airfare prices for flights departing from Los Angeles International Airport (LAX) using data from the 2018 Airplane Flights dataset. The study explores how variables such as distance traveled, airline company, number of tickets ordered, seasonality, and competition among airlines impact ticket prices. Key findings include a strong positive correlation between distance and price, lower prices for bulk ticket purchases, and higher fares for flights to hub airports dominated by a single airline. Statistical methods such as ANOVA, chi-square tests, and linear regression confirm significant differences in pricing across destinations. While the study provides insights into airfare pricing trends, factors like booking time, demand fluctuations, and fuel prices remain unexplored and could be investigated in future research.

#### Factors Contributing to Happiness

This project analyzes factors influencing happiness using data from the 2019 World Happiness Report. Through multiple linear regression, the study identifies GDP per capita, social support, healthy life expectancy, and freedom to make life choices as the most significant predictors of happiness, while generosity and perceptions of corruption were found statistically insignificant. After data transformations and variable selection, a four-variable model was determined to be the best fit. The findings align with government policies aimed at improving well-being through economic growth, social welfare, healthcare, and civil liberties. However, cultural differences, time dependency, and subjectivity in measuring happiness limit the studyâ€™s generalizability.

#### Time Series Analysis and Forecasting of GOOG and S&P 500

Link to [PDF Document](Econ 144 Project 2.pdf)

This project analyzes the historical price movements of Google (GOOG) and the S&P 500 ETF (SPY) to develop predictive models for financial markets. Using ARIMA and VAR models, the study assesses time-series forecasting accuracy and the relationship between individual stock performance and broader market trends. The ARIMA models effectively captured past price patterns, showing strong predictive power, while the VAR model identified a bidirectional Granger-causal relationship between Google and the S&P 500. However, ARIMA-based models performed better in forecasting accuracy (lower MAPE) than VAR. The study highlights how historical trends can predict future movements, but market shocks and external factors must be considered for real-world applications. Future research could expand on interdependencies between multiple tech stocks.
